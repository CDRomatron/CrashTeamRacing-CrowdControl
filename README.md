# CrashTeamRacing-CrowdControl
Crowd Control Extension for Crash Team Racing - PS1


How to run:

When choosing a game, choose the custom game pack as the ccpak file in releases
Once Bizhawk launches, navigate to the lua window, open script, and choose CTR-CC.lua from releases


Known issues:
Removing items sometimes removes keys
Obtaining Roo key for a second time before getting other keys causes a softlock
Being given a trophy as a prize in the overworld, then entering the trophy race crashes the game
-Same with recieving an item whilst doing the race for the item
Rare disconnects from crowd control (unknown cause, most likey a CC issue)
Need to choose Edit Items from crowd control for the effects to appear in the extension (unknown cause, most likey a CC issue)
